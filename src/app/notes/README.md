WebNotes client
=================

This is a web app created for writing notes at school. I made it just for my own purposes. Feel free to copy.

API
-----

You wil find api in another repository. It's not secured so it's usefull for local use only.

TAB problem
---

Because tabs don't work in textarea you have to put three spaces in order to replace them with tab.

Adding a subject
-----

You can add subject in navbar at the top of site by clicking enter.

Editing and creating notes
--------

You can edit note with MARKDOWN compatible with Showdown.js. You can create note by clicking add note in navbar or edit existing note by accessing it from start screen and than clicking edit button. Content will auto save existing files every minute.
